# StudentChallenges

StudentChallenges is an independent initiative by the alumni of CS50, welcoming students from all around the world. Our platform is not affiliated with edX, Harvard, or CS50, and is solely developed and maintained by the CS50 alum community.

## Our Initiatives

- **Student-Crafted Problem Sets:** Dive into challenges created by your fellow students to enhance your problem-solving skills.
- **Student-Crafted Capture The Flag Challenges:** Test your cybersecurity skills with challenges crafted by students.
- **Student-Initiated Hackathons:** Join hackathons initiated by students, fostering creativity and innovation.
- **And more...:** Explore a variety of student-led activities, offering diverse learning experiences and collaborative endeavors.

Join us on this collaborative learning journey where students shape the challenges and drive the entire learning experience!
